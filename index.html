          Earth is made up of complex, interactive systems that create a
          constantly changing world that we are striving to understand. From the
          vantage point of space, we are able to observe our planet globally,
          using sensitive instruments to understand the delicate balance among
          its oceans, air, land, and life. NASA satellite observations help
          study and predict weather, drought, pollution, climate change, and
          many other phenomena that affect the environment, economy, and
          society.
